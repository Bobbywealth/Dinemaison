DINE MAISON
Full Product, Business & Technical Blueprint (MVP → Scale)
1. Company Overview
Company Name

Dine Maison

Tagline

“The Art of Intimate Dining.”

Core Concept

Dine Maison is a two-sided marketplace that connects customers looking to book private chefs and intimate dining experiences with chefs offering those services.

Think:

Airbnb → trust + profiles + reviews

Uber → on-demand booking + payments

Applied to private chefs & intimate dining

2. Problem Being Solved

Today, customers struggle to:

Find reliable private chefs

Compare cuisines, dietary specialties, and experiences

Trust quality without centralized reviews

Book and pay easily

Chefs struggle to:

Get consistent bookings

Handle payments, cancellations, and admin

Build visibility and reputation

Dine Maison solves both sides.

3. Marketplace Model (Hybrid Supply)
A. Marketplace Chefs (Independent)

Create profiles

Set availability and pricing

Get booked directly

Pay platform commission

B. Dine Maison Certified / Staff Chefs

Curated, vetted chefs

Used when customer wants:

Simplicity

Speed

“Dine Maison standard”

Higher platform margin

Admin can assign chefs manually

This hybrid model increases trust, reliability, and revenue.

4. Launch Markets

NY / NJ

Tampa Bay (Tampa / St. Pete / Clearwater)

(Admin can enable/disable markets.)

5. Pricing & Monetization
Customer Fees

Full payment upfront

Optional tip (checkout or post-event)

Small platform service fee (flat or %)

Chef Fees

Marketplace chefs: 15–20% commission

(Admin controls all pricing rules.)

6. Payment Flow (Locked for MVP)

Customer books → full payment charged

Funds held (Stripe)

Event completed

Chef paid after hold window (24–48 hours)

Tips released with payout

For fastest MVP:

Stripe payments first

Manual payouts acceptable initially

Stripe Connect added once stable

7. Cancellation & Refund Policy (MVP)

20. Final Reality Check – What You Need to Build

To launch Dine Maison properly, you need:

✅ Web app
✅ Customer dashboard
✅ Chef dashboard
✅ Admin dashboard
✅ Booking + payment working end-to-end
✅ At least 1 real chef
✅ At least 1 real booking

Anything beyond that is optimization, not launch-blocking.
